> Project 09

|**Description**|
|-----------|
|**This Project  designed using pure HTML & CSS, nothing more than this.**  |

## Skills updated through this

- Got idea about position(Absolute, relative, fixed).  
- Import stylish font and link them to use in webpage.  
- Learned about z-index, set margin and padding of buttons.
- Learned about CSS Positioning, Relative, Absolute. Also position: fixed;. Explored display: flex; to new heights and applied it 
- Just to mention flex-wrap: wrap; can be a life savor at times. Although I have not written any media queries the text content wraps pretty nicely due to flex-wrap: wrap;. By default it is set to flex-wrap: no-wrap;.

- lots of media query stuffs used there.
